# Student Result Prediction System

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The Student Result Prediction System uses AI to predict whether students will pass or fail based on factors like attendance, assignment scores, and previous academic performance. This helps educators identify at-risk students early and provide targeted interventions.

## Background

Many students struggle academically due to a lack of timely support. Teachers often cannot identify struggling students early because of limited resources or large class sizes.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Teachers miss early warning signs of poor performance.
* High dropout rates due to inadequate academic support.
* Over-reliance on final exams to assess progress.

My motivation comes from the need to improve learning outcomes and reduce dropout rates in educational institutions using data-driven approaches.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

### Process:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather student data like attendance, assignment scores, and past performance.
2. **Training the Model:** Train an AI model to analyze data and predict results.
3. **Prediction:** Input current data to predict student outcomes.
4. **Intervention:** Teachers use predictions to focus on struggling students.

### Users:
- Teachers and educators.
- School administrators.
- Students and their guardians.
- 






## Data sources and AI methods

### Data Sources:
1. **Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD):**
   [Link](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset)
2. **UCI Student Performance Dataset:**
   [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

### AI Methods:
- Logistic Regression: For pass/fail classification.
- Random Forests: To handle complex datasets and provide interpretability.
- Neural Networks: For large datasets with complex patterns.
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost): For robust predictive performance.


## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

1. **Data Quality:** Predictions depend on clean, unbiased data.
2. **Bias:** Models may reinforce societal inequalities if data is biased.
3. **Ethical Issues:** Ensure compliance with data privacy laws like GDPR.
4. **Interpretability:** Educators may need clear explanations of the AI's predictions.

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you need to move on?

1. Expand predictions to subject-specific performance.
2. Integrate with school management systems for real-time updates.
3. Develop dashboards for better visualization of student progress.
4. Scale the project to work across different educational systems and institutions.
